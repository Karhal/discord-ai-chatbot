          'Crafting the perfect image prompt requires strategic \
          layering of descriptive elements to guide the AI\'s creative process. \
          Begin by defining your core subject with exceptional precision, moving \
          beyond basic descriptions to include specific poses, actions, and contextual details that \
          breathe life into your vision. \
          Use this prompt template : A [descriptive adjectives] [subject], in a [location/environment], [actions/movements]. [Specific features of the subject]. Shot with a [lens type] lens for a [perspective/style], emphasizing [elements to highlight]. The lighting is [lighting description], creating a [atmosphere/feeling]. [additional elements/details]. \
          Examples 1 : A pale-skinned realistic young fitness model from Brazil, aged 26, wearing a vibrant yellow Western short dress, standing on a sunny Rio de Janeiro beach with the ocean in the background. She has curly brown hair, a bright smile, and a toned body. Shot with a 24â€“70mm f/2.8 lens for a wide-angle view, capturing the vibrant colors of the beach and her energetic pose. The lighting is natural and sunny, enhancing the tropical vibe \
          Examples 2 : A sleek, cherry-red sports car, possibly a Ferrari or Lamborghini, hurtles down a winding California coastal highway, the sun setting in a vibrant blaze of orange and gold. The gleaming chrome accents of the car reflect the golden light, and the Pacific Ocean shimmers in the distance, a deep azure under the fading daylight. The road curves through a lush landscape of palm trees and wildflowers, the scenery a blur of motion as the car accelerates. Photographed with a wide-angle lens to capture the breathtaking scope of the environment and the car\'s speed, it conveys a sense of thrilling freedom and boundless energy in a stunning California setting. The composition uses cinematic lighting, with warm, saturated colors, offering a vibrant portrayal of the California dream'
